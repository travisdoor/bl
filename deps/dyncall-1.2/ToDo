1.3:
----
- test atpcs thumb on arm and verify if ellipsis and C++ thiscalls work, if so adapt doc appendix
- test eabi thumb on arm and verify if ellipsis and C++ thiscalls work, if so adapt doc appendix
- new platform matrix
  * check dark green cells and validate in general
- openbsd-4.0-* test/resolve_self fails, but unsure why. dlopen correctly returns RTLD_DEFAULT, which
  should lookup via dlsym the function in the object itself, but cannot. So... some compiler flag might
  be missing to keep symbol names, or some prefixing happens
- test/thunk win/x64 doesn't output anything decent for stack test (neither sigsegv nor output), which can create a problem for test log file as it'll mess with the subsequent test's output)
- remove test/gen-masm alltogether
- test code: add sparc tests for when out of register windows, meaning multiple layers deep in the call stack
- ./configure on macOS does not pass CFLAGS etc.. to Makefile.config
- support platforms without shared libraries so they can be built by just typing `./configure;make` (e.g. minix < 3.2.1)
  * also make sure minix with shared library support builds and works in general (>= 3.2.1) as well as ELF on Minix (>= 3.2.0) to begin with (as that's the base, and we only test on 3.1.8 so far)
- dyncall supports calls to functions where prototype exists (with and without varargs); however not when no
  prototype exist (e.g. just calling some pointer), without any declaration... even possible in C, as one has
  to cast to the function type? need to support?
- dyncallback's "stack_cleanup" can be removed from non x86 impls... test if they still work
- target a minimum c version, for use with -pedantic, etc.? Right now we use e.g. extensions
  for anon structs, etc. -> we do now target c99
- the CallVM-free functions are per VTable, however the latter can be changed out
  at runtime... which basically changes potentially the deallocator...
  same goes for functions setting the mode. think about how to make this safer - currently
  we have a higher flexibility and we need to potentially clean up from the mode we are in,
  however, this is open to misuse
- check all vararg calling conv implementations if they promote correctly
  (e.g. float to double); we used to not care as it was the user's job to
  think of that, but we allow users to use ArgFloat, etc. on "..." now,
  taking care of the promotion; so it should be consistent all across the
  implementations -> also write testcode specifically for that
- autovar was never really pushed all the way through and still plays second
  fiddle to dyncall_macros.h, clean this all up, eventually (Tassilo: for now, I
  removed out of sync files to avoid confusion; but still probably duped code)
- add portable "make install"
  * make install should also install manpages
- fix for NDS:
  * ARM:
    - callback_plain retval wrong (not only platform), area on stack where
      it's stored is probably not zeroed, so half-words, etc., come with garbage
  * THUMB:
    - ellipsis (might be test itself, not respecting fixed part of args)
    - callback_plain retval, see above under ARM
    - callf
- support Solaris11 CFLAGS with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
- make sure selinux works (esp. regarding NX bits)
  Daniel has a patch for it, if needed, implementing allocwx with two memory blocks, one for w^x, mmaped to one for r|x
- support /SAFESEH on cl/win32
- test code functions should be in .so files, optionally, so the suites can directly be used to test dyncall bindings
- pkg-config support?
- add tests using alloca(), as this might depend on the frame pointer being correctly set (we don't
  check for this, currently, at all - but might not affect dyncall's stubs, anyways) - verify

portasm:
--------
- add solaris support for x64

dyncall:
--------
- dyncall sparc v7/v8: -xO3 on SunPro segfaults in tests (observed years ago)
- callbacks and use of CC signature characters (only x86 has any support for different CCs for callbacks):
  * support for arm (arm/thumb on same platform)
  * check if ellipsis support is needed (is there any need for calling back into an ellipse function?)
  * check if syscalls support is needed (is there any need for calling back into a syscall?)
- think about using 'inline' for all/most dyncall_api.c functions?
- support for where syscalls originate from on OpenBSD: http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20191202105849
- merge arm32_thumb_{gas/apple} and include thumb support for portasm
- x64 verification: return values are passed via RAX and RDX, and XMM0 and XMM1.
- find big endian arm box (also hardfloat), e.g. cubietruck: http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/working_arm_multiprocessor_support
- test if armhf/thumb is actually working... pulls in arm mode code in dyncall_callvm.c
- dyncall_call_mips_n32.h and dyncall_call_mips_n64.h are pretty much the same, share code
- support for return values: aggregate return values
- support for argument values: structures, half-precision, vector types, long double (c89)
- support for argument values: _Complex (c99)
- support for argument values: Fixed-width integer types (c99) - could be just aliases but would help abstracting it away from library users
  * make sure that struct support for ellipsis calls are not forgotten (copy everything by value)
- consider automatic type-promotion for arguments passed through DC_CALL_C_ELLIPSIS_VARARGS;
  this would make it easier to just pass arguments instead of having to know about the C
  type promotions (this is partly done, see todo-item above under 1.1)
- other syscalls
- test MIPS32 eabi big endian (current port works on psp, which is little endian)
- implement MIPS64 N32 (gcc -mabi=n32); both, little and big-endian (looks like NetNBSD on and
  EdgeRouter lite uses this: https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/hands_on_experience_with_edgerouter)
- MIPS64 n32 softfloat support (-msoft-float)
- implement MIPS64 EABI (gcc -mabi=eabi); both, little and big-endian
- support for Minix/arm
- improve ellipsis test:
  * test not just with one fixed arg, to also simulate alignment problems
  * test return values
  * convert from c++ to c, to have it also on plan9, and more portability

dynload:
--------
- investigate issue where if dlGetLibraryPath() is called from within a .so,
  passing NULL will return .so name, whereas passing result of
  dlLoadLibrary(NULL) returns process' name
- dlGetLibraryPath: dl_iterate_phdr() used on OpenBSD, but not available on version < 3.7
- bug: test/nm crashes on qemu mips linux o32 debian etch
- rename SymsInit to InitSyms and similar for cleanup function to reflect naming
  in dyncall
- get rid of Dl_info and friends (_GNU_SOURCE) in dynload/dynload_syms_elf.c
  for implementation of dlSymsNameFromValue(..)
- check if PSP can support dynload (missing elf.h, dlfcn.h, etc.); fixup readme if successful
- some functionality like java's System.mapLibraryName('name') might be helpful?
- Failed On Open Solaris 11:
    In file included from dynload_syms.c:28:
    dynload_syms_elf.c:56: error: syntax error before "Elf_Dyn"

    dynload_syms_elf.c:165: error: `DT_HASH' undeclared (first use in this function)
    make: *** [dynload_syms.o] Error 1

dyncallback:
------------
- callback_plain's return value not correct anymore on NDS (maybe just broken testcode?),
  see above under 1.1 items
  * check other platforms also, if asm stub initializes retval space, correctly
- test MIPS32 eabi big endian (current port works on psp, which is little endian)
- implement MIPS64 N32 (gcc -mabi=n32); both, little and big-endian (looks like NetNBSD on and
  EdgeRouter lite uses this: https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/hands_on_experience_with_edgerouter)
- MIPS64 n32 softfloat support (-msoft-float)
- implement MIPS64 EABI (gcc -mabi=eabi); both, little and big-endian
- support for Minix/arm

bindings:
---------
- release bindings as standalone packages (already done for rbdc as a gem and rdyncall on cran)
  * add note to documentation, where bindings are
- add rdoc documentation to ruby gem
- add pydoc for python
- add manpage for shdc
- expose callf-convenience functions to godc
- add godoc for godc
- add javadoc to java
- add more bindings
- add callback support for erlang, go, java, lua, python and ruby (and shell? how?)
- add call-conv-mode-support for rbdc through signature

manual:
-------
- introduce doc overview tables and common vocab for calling convention specifics, following example of table on page 13 of
  https://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/doc/ABI/MIPS-N32-ABI-Handbook.pdf; also as inspiration, e.g. user 'preserved' instead of 'permanent', etc.
  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/Articles/ARMv6FunctionCallingConventions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009021-SW4
  * also, get inspiration for naming for GCC predefs as talked about in https://stffrdhrn.github.io/software/embedded/openrisc/2018/06/08/gcc_stack_frames.html
- make stack layout diagrams better, e.g. add grow direction (example: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/art/arm_stack.jpg on https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/Articles/ARMv6FunctionCallingConventions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009021-SW1)
  * another example, chapter 3 of: ftp://www.sourceware.org/pub/binutils/ppc-docs/ppc-poweropen/
- provide more examples on how to use dyncall, dynload and dyncallback
  * e.g. enhance manual with a couple of examples (e.g. calling MessageBoxA on windows, etc.)
- manuals for bindings (as stated in bindings-section, above)
- under "dyncall support", in each calling convention appendix, list crucial details of e.g. big/little endian support, etc.
- specify integer models in use, use common ILP32, LLP64, etc. terms

regressions:
------------
- Solaris/gmake build doesn't build dynload and tests anymore (maybe not even dyncallback)
- look over code and fix TODO or @@@ marks

nice to have:
-------------
- update: microsoft visual c++ build files - integrate all test suites in solution file
- consistency: on x64 platforms: make both ABIs available ('win64','sysv') for all x64 OS ports
- microsoft build enhancement: autodetect assembly via C preprocessor (like with .S gcc files)
- test/thunk: some platforms do not allow for allocation of executable code on heap and stack -- 
  currently this test will segfault (handled), maybe we should collect information which platforms allow and which not.
- PSP
	- automate ppsspp stuff, seems to print to stdout for callback_suite? but not for call_suite.. (?)
	- fix link with dummy versions of the following for test-bins:
		void __stack_chk_fail(){}
		void __stack_chk_guard(){}

bugs:
-----
- setting callconv, specifically for platforms that have only one (default)) excepts on some
  platforms, eg. setting X64_sysv on amd64/Linux - keeping cdecl which is the same in
  this case, works (this should work now...)
- vararg function calls don't work for ARM THUMB mode (Daniel's new interface for modesetting for varag
  args should be used); adapt test/ellipsis and/or retest
