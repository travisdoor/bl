* Ideas 
  - [X] make builder global
  - [X] enable implicit casting only to bigger integer type and check signed unsigned also 
  - [ ] reimplement LLVM-C binding
  - [X] add MirArg
  - [ ] document instruction Arg
  - [ ] pass all structures passed by value as pointers into the functions and make copy inside. 
  - [ ] support of #extend hash directive for struct inherritance? 
  - [X] replace , by ; in structs and enums  
  - [ ] #flags enum?
  - [ ] Simple structure inherritance with #using, #base or some keyword?
  - [ ] Update documentation (we are using recursive git repository)
  - [X] Switch to tlib-c 
  - [ ] Operator overloading

* parser race conditions
  - arena_alloc 
  - create scope

* structure with pointer to self
