# System

Collection of operating system interface imported implicitly.

## Standard IO

Standard input and output is implemented using the builtin [Stream](/modules/io) abstraction, so all common stream manipulation methods
like `read` and `write` can be used. Use following methods to obtain the stream handle.

```c
OsStdIoStream :: struct #base std.Stream {
    handle: win32.HANDLE;
}

// Standard input stream
os_stdin :: fn () *OsStdIoStream
// Standard output stream.
os_stdout :: fn () *OsStdIoStream
// Standard output error stream.
os_stderr :: fn () *OsStdIoStream
```

In general, you can use i.e. Standard Output Stream for printing into the console, however using [print](/modules/print) function is
more elegant in most situations.

!!! note
    On Windows the terminal output is encoded to UTF-8 by defautl using winapi function `SetConsoleOutputCP`.

## os_execute

```c
os_execute :: fn (command: string_view) s32
```

Execute shell `command` and return the command output state as an integer.

## os_get_last_error

```c
os_get_last_error :: fn () (s32, string_view) #inline
```

Return last known operating system dependent error code.

## os_get_exec_path

```c
os_get_exec_path :: fn () string
```

Returns a full path to the currently running executable; internally a new string is allocated and must be deleted after use.
The path may be empty in case of an error.

## os_get_backtrace

Returns current execution stack trace obtained from native executable debug information. This feature is available only in `DEBUG` mode
and only during native runtime. Output slice of [CodeLocations](/modules/a/#codelocation) contains stack frame records starting from the
`os_get_backtrace` caller function + `skip_frames`. The `max_frame_count` can limit maximum count of obtained frames.

!!! note
    This function internally allocate using current application context temporary allocator.

```c
os_get_backtrace :: fn (skip_frames := 0, max_frame_count := 64) []CodeLocation
```
